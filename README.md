# Yelp Photo Classification
[Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/) is a social networking site that publishes crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses. About two years ago, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) hosted the Yelp Restaurant Photo Classification challenge. Since labels are optional during the review submission process, some restaurants can be left uncategorized. For this reason, Yelp asked contestants to build an algorithm that automatically predict attributes for restaurants using their user-submitted photographs. The goal of this project is to develop such a model.
